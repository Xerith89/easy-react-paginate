## Easy React Pagination

### What Is It?

A simple component that makes pagination in ReactJS incredibly easy!

### How To Use

Clone the project or copy the code from the Pagination component into your project.
The project uses bootstrap CSS and the fortawesome react module as dependencies. Make sure there is a link to bootstrap somewhere, preferable index.html and that you run npm install.

From then you just need to import the component wrap and embed your display component as children.
